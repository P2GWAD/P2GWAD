# P2GWAD
You can find our Web App Play2Gether in the folder Play2Gether. This level (P2GWAD) was originally used, to exchange other data as well 
and therefore the App is stored in an extra directory.

The requirement.txt file is alos located in the Play2Gether folder.

If there are problems during the registration process, where you cannot reach step 2, please choose a more secure password.

As I am not sure whether you need the key to run it locally I have pushed it here (eventhough I know that one shoul keep the key secret...)
